This is a personal repository to test various styling and animations in the react format, each react app has a very simple but specific use
and will be used by me in the future as a reference for other web projects.

1. Fade
    a simple fade in of a div on page load, attempt at using react-spring (most likely come back to this dependency, figuring out base animation 
    first)
    dependencies: react, react-spring.

2. move_box
    a simple transition and moving of a box sized div over the page, done with several different
    speeds using the translation property in CSS
    dependencies: react

3. expandable_text_box
    This was an issue with animation that was a large problem for me for a while but now i have figured out how to properly expand a box with actual
    content inside using smooth animation.
    dependencies: react

4. on_render_move_box
    First attempt at having animations begin when a specific part of the page is rendered instead of immediatley on website launch or on the click of
    a button.
